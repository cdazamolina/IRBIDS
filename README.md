# I read but I don't speak

This is our entry for the TADHack-mini Phoenix with Avaya ENGAGE, that took place between Feb 1 and Feb 2, 2020 for more information on the Hackathon please check https://tadhack.com/2020/mini-phoenix/

## The problem

When non-natives try to learn a second language, one of the biggest barriers for it is shyness and self-conciousness and it is very common 
to hear, when talking about a second language that "I can read it, but I don't speak it", or in spanish "Lo entiendo pero no lo hablo".

This hack tries to address this by creating an engaging way to learn english for non-natives. It attempts to reduce the self consciousness by providing an automated way of grading, and by using the phone. 

## The Hack

We created a game that uses artificial intelligence to help improve the pronunciation of non-native speakers using the phone. 
There is a voice app that you can call at +1 916 860 1204. The app will ask you to repeat a given phrase and check how well you did it. Your score will be saved on a database and you will be able to see how it improves over time. The results are avaiable on http://irbids.ingenian.com
